# Angular 4 Reference Application

This Project is created for reference purposes of personal or Open Source angular projects for beginners. This project uses all the basic concepts of Angular. You can find reference for all the topics in Angular like Components Communication, Modules, AJAX Calls, Populating grid using JSON data, Pipes and many more. Below is the proper reference for codes in each section and how it is working. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.7. If anyone among you who clone or find any changes please collaborate and help me do so. Detailed documentation is as below.

## Getting the Project up & running

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) first of all by going to its official website. (You can click on node.js to redirect to the download page).
Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` from command prompt to install [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart).
Run `git clone https://github.com/codegauravg/reference-ng-app` to git clone the repository to your preferred directory or Fork it and the Clone it using Github Desktop application.
After you are done with it, navigate to your directory where project is cloned and run `npm install`. This will install the dependencies used in this project and is listed in package.json file like Bootstrap 3.7.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Your Angular app is now up and running. Have Fun !!! ;)

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
All the components, pipes, services, class, interfaces are created using the above command only.
`ng generate` not only just generates the file but also adds it's import in the `app.module.ts` file.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
